*Business Goal* :

We aim to segment the Customers based on RFM (Recency/Frequency/Monetary) so that the company can target its customers efficiently.

*What Is Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value (RFM)* ?

- Recency, frequency, monetary value is a marketing analysis tool used to identify a company's or an organization's best customers by using certain measures. The RFM model is based on three quantitative factors:

- Recency: How recently a customer has made a purchase

- Frequency: How often a customer makes a purchase

Monetary Value: How much money a customer spends on purchases

RFM analysis numerically ranks a customer in each of these three categories, generally on a scale of 1 to 5 (the higher the number, the better the result). The "best" customer would receive a top score in every category.
